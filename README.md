### Project description
  Our project intends to obtain X-ray images of knees and categorize them into one of five grades based on level of severity. The project will rely on Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading, a scoring system for categorizing the severity of osteoarthritis from 0 to 4. The grades are as follows: 0 = healthy knee, no osteoarthritis. 1 = doubtful, joint narrowing with possible osteophytic lipping. 2 = minimal, presence of osteophytes and possible joint space narrowing. 3 = moderate, multiple osteophytes and definite joint space narrowing plus mild sclerosis. 4 = severe, large osteophytes, significant joint narrowing, and severe sclerosis. Our project is an example of how machine learning could help doctors and medical professionals accurately diagnose patients, and it could also be used as a learning tool for aspiring medical personnel. Our project will use a dataset found on Kaggle, "Knee Osteoarthritis Dataset with Severity Grading" (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/knee-osteoarthritis-dataset-with-severity/data). Our goal is to use the images provided in the dataset and successfully implement machine learning to accurately categorize the images into the appropriate severity grades.
